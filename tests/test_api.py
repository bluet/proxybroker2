"""Test Broker public API - focused on user-visible behavior.

This file tests the main Broker APIs that users depend on:
- Constructor with various options
- grab(): Get proxies without checking (populates queue)
- find(): Find and validate proxies (populates queue)
- serve(): Run proxy server
- Error handling and edge cases

We focus on WHAT the API does, not HOW it does it.
Based on the correct usage pattern from examples/basic.py
